# Love's Dumpling House
October 10, 2025\
For the past decade, I have been going to restaurants around Houston and have come across many great ones. One goal of mine has been to find a great restaurant that I could repeatedly go to and still experience the same greatness as the first time. Recently, I discovered Love’s Dumpling House, a Chinese restaurant focused on dumplings located in Katy, TX. \Address: 2944 S Mason Rd Ste P, Katy, TX 77450
## Dishes
My favorite dish is their Spicy Wontons in Red Oil. The wonton wrap is at the right firmness and thinness; it is constructed in multiple flaps to hold on the soup, more on that later. The wonton encloses pork & shrimp; just the right size. My favorite part of the dish is the soup: it harbors a great proportion between sourness, spiciness, and umami. The sourness adds to the pork & shrimp: the taste can be compared to dipping dumplings into dark vinegar, though milder, so I always add bit more vinegar myself. The spiciness is subtle but acts as a refresher that lets the wontons strike the same deliciousness every time. The umami taste is rich and can be compared to miso soup; chopped pieces of scallions add to the umami and presentation of the dish.

Going to a dumplings restaurant, I had to order the pork Xiao Long Bao. These soup dumplings were full of umami, and their wrappers came in great condition at the right firmness. The pork inside is on the softer side compared to the wontons.  

Another popular Chinese dumpling variation is the Fried Thumb Bun, which I ordered with the Pork & Scallion filling. My favorite way of eating these is by dipping these fully into dark vinegar. The bun was presented in great condition; its shell was fried and had a crisp to it on the bottom. If you have never tried fried buns, this dish is a must order; the crisp shell is a unique experience that everyone should try. 

Love’s Dumpling House is a hidden gem right in Cinco Ranch. Even after visiting China in the summer and trying out numerous dishes, Spicy Wontons in Red Oil by Love’s Dumpling House remain in the top tier of wontons I’ve tried. When you want to try simple but delicious wontons with a touch of spice to it in Houston, you should consider this place.
